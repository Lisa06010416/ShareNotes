Scala provides language interoperability with Java so that libraries written in either language may be referenced directly in Scala or Java code. ​ Scala has a faster execution speed than Python and is more flexible than Java, making it suitable for big data pipelines that need to be rerun daily or hourly.\nFeature/Aspect Java Scala Python Language Type Compiled, statically typed Compiled, statically typed\nSupports functional and object-oriented programming Interpreted, dynamically typed Performance High performance High performance Slightly slower than Java due to functional features. Lower performance Flexibility Low Medium High Primary Use Cases Enterprise applications, large-scale backend services, Android development Distributed systems, big data (e.g., Spark), applications requiring expressiveness and performance Rapid development, data science, machine learning, scripting automation Big Data Support Supports frameworks like Hadoop but requires more boilerplate code Native support for Apache Spark with user-friendly syntax Via libraries like PySpark, with slightly lower performance than Java/Scala Compiled v.s. Interpreted\nFeature Compiled Languages Interpreted Languages Execution Speed Fast (precompiled to machine code) Slow (interpreted at runtime) Development Speed Slower (requires compilation) Faster (no compilation step) Error Detection Errors caught at compile-time Errors detected at runtime Portability Platform-dependent (requires recompilation) High (interpreter handles portability) Typical Examples C, C++, Java, Scala Python Statically Typed v.s. Dynamically Typed\nFeature Statically Typed Dynamically Typed Type Checking At compile-time (types fixed after declaration) At runtime (types can change dynamically) Error Detection Caught during compilation Caught during execution Performance Faster runtime (no type-checking overhead) Slower runtime (type-checking at runtime) Examples C, C++, Java, Scala Python Variables Feature Scala (val and var) Java (final and general variables) Immutable Constant Uses val, reassignment not allowed. Uses final modifier, value cannot be changed. Mutable Variable Uses var, allows reassignment. General variables without final allow reassignment. Type Inference Supports type inference, type declaration can be omitted. Requires explicit type declaration (Java 10+ supports var). Flow Control Here show how Scala to do flow control and compare the behavior with Java if need.\nFor :\nfor (i \u003c- 1 to 10 if i % 2 == 0) { // for loop with a condition println(i) // Output: 2 4 6 8 10 } for (i \u003c- 1 to 3; j \u003c- 1 to 2) { println(s\"$i $j\") // Output: 1 1, 1 2, 2 1, ... } val squares = for (i \u003c- 1 to 5) yield i * i // Yielding a result println(squares) // output: Vector(1, 4, 9, 16, 25) IF else:\nScala v.s. Java\nScala: If-else in scala is a expression which means it can return value.\nval x = 10 val result = if (x \u003e 5) \"Greater\" else \"Smaller\" println(result) // Output: Greater Java: In Java if-else is a statement, can’t directly return value\nString result; if (x \u003e 5) { result = \"Greater\"; } else { result = \"Smaller\"; } While and do while\n// while var x = 5 while (x \u003e 0) { println(x) x -= 1 } // do while var y = 5 do { println(y) y -= 1 } while (y \u003e 0) Match and case\nval x = 10 x match { case i if i \u003e 5 =\u003e println(\"Greater\") case i if i \u003e 0 =\u003e println(\"Smaller\") case _ =\u003e println(\"Zero\") } Class and Object Scala v.s. Java in Object and Class The difference behavior on object between Java ans Scala:\nFeature Scala Java Static Members Scala does not have static members(functions or fields). Instead, programmers declare these members in singleton objects. Java defines static members for basic types and fields using the static keyword. Primitive vs Reference Types Scala treats everything as objects, including numbers and functions. Java separates primitive types (e.g., boolean, int) from reference types and cannot treat functions as variables. Object-Oriented Nature Scala is a purely object-oriented language. This means everything is an object, including numbers and functions. Java is object-oriented but has primitive types and does not treat them as objects. Class v.s. Object A basic object in Scala:\ncallback: () =\u003e Unit : Input a variable named callback. The : specifies the type of the variable, which is a function. This function is a method that takes no parameters () and has no return value =\u003e Unit. In Scala, Unit is similar to void in other programming languages. Object SayHelloPerSec { def sayHelloPerSceond(callback: () =\u003e Unit) { while (true) { callback(); Thread sleep 1000 } } def sayHello() { println(\"Hello world ...\") } def main(args: Array[Sting]): Unit = { sayHelloPerSceond(sayHello) } } Object Class Object v.s. Class It is a concrete instance of a class, representing things in the real world. It is used to store data and execute methods.\nIn Scala, you can directly declare an object. An object in Scala is a singleton object, used to represent a class with only one instance.\nUsed to define the common characteristics and behaviors of objects. It is just a concept and does not exist concretely. constructer Can’t pass constructer parameter in object\nobject Add Support constructer parameter\nclass Add(a: Double, b: Double) static Typically used for static function and constants. No companion object It can be used as a companion object in conjunction with a class, sharing the same name as the class and mutually accessing each other’s private members.\nIn Scala, there is no static modifier like in Java. Companion objects are the primary way to implement static methods and constants.\nIn Factory Method provides a unified interface for creating objects.\nNo Object Anonymous function () =\u003e println(\"Hello world ...\") :\n( ) : Indicates that the function takes no parameters (the input is empty).\n=\u003e: Signifies that what follows is an anonymous function (a function without a name).\nObject SayHellowPerSec { def sayHelloPerSceond(callback: () =\u003e Unit) { while (true) { callback(); Thread sleep 1000 } } def main(args: Array[Sting]): Unit = { sayHelloPerSceond(() =\u003e println(\"Hello world ...\")) } } Interface and Inherent Inherient class Parent { def greet(): Unit = println(\"Hello from Parent\") } class Child extends Parent { override def greet(): Unit = println(\"Hello from Child\") // must use override } ​ Abstract Java :Abstract methods must be marked with the abstract keyword.\nScala: Abstract methods do not need to be marked with the abstract keyword; as long as the method has no implementation, it is considered abstract.\nabstract class Animal { def makeSound(): Unit // Abstract methods，no `abstract` } class Dog extends Animal { override def makeSound(): Unit = println(\"Woof!\") } ​ Multiple Inheritance Java：When multiple interfaces have the same default method, the subclass must explicitly choose which method to use; otherwise, the compilation will fail.\nScala：Conflicts are resolved using linearization, where the method in the rightmost trait overrides the methods from other traits.\nFeature Scala Java Multiple Inheritance Supports multiple traits Interfaces support multiple inheritance (Java 8+ supports default methods) Visibility protected Accessible only by subclasses Accessible by subclasses and classes in the same package trait Support Supports concrete methods and variables, allows multiple stacking Does not support variables, only supports default methods (Java 8+) ​ Scala Trait Scala use Trait support multiple inferitance and solve diamon inferientance problems\nAn example:\ntrait Animal { def sound(): Unit // abstract method def eat(): Unit = println(\"Eating...\") // concrete method } trait Swimmer { def swim(): Unit = println(\"Swimming...\") } trait Flyer { def fly(): Unit = println(\"Flying...\") } class Duck extends Animal with Swimmer with Flyer { // implement abstract method override def sound(): Unit = println(\"Quack Quack\") } object Main extends App { val duck = new Duck() duck.sound() // Quack Quack duck.swim() // Swimming... duck.fly() // Flying... } Scala uses the concept of linearization (Last First) to resolve conflicts. Even with multiple traits, Scala will flatten them into a single, unique inheritance hierarchy.\nThe diamond inheritance problem: D might be confused about which function to inherit when B and C have the same function. A / \\ B C \\ / D trait Animal { def sound(): Unit // abstract method def eat(): Unit = println(\"Eating...\") // concrete method } trait Swimmer extends Animal { override def eat(): Unit = println(\"Eating while swimming...\") def swim(): Unit = println(\"Swimming...\") } trait Flyer extends Animal { override def eat(): Unit = println(\"Eating while flying...\") def fly(): Unit = println(\"Flying...\") } class Duck extends Swimmer with Flyer { // implement abstract method override def sound(): Unit = println(\"Quack Quack\") } object Main extends App { val duck = new Duck() duck.sound() // Quack Quack duck.eat() // Eating while flying... (Last first) duck.swim() // Swimming... duck.fly() // Flying... } ​ Generics Description Java * Java programmers adopt Object as the superclass of all objects. * This approach is limited: it doesn’t support primitive types and requires manual type casting. Scala * Scala addresses this issue by allowing the definition of generic classes (and functions). ​ Here is an example of generic:\nBox[T]: The use of T indicates that the class is generic. private var contents: T = _: The initial value of this variable is _, which represents the default value for the type T. For numeric types, the default value is 0; for Boolean, it is false; for Unit, it is (); and for all object types, it is null. val intBox = new Box[Int]() : When initializing a Box, you must specify the type parameter T. class Box[T](private var content: Option[T] = None) { private var contents: T = _ def getContent: T = contents def setContent(value: T): Unit = {contents = value} } object GenericExample { def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = { // Create an uninitialized Box of Int val intBox = new Box[Int]() intBox.setContent(42) println(s\"Integer Box contains: ${intBox.getContent}\") // Create an uninitialized Box of String val stringBox = new Box[String]() stringBox.setContent(\"Scala Generics\") println(s\"String Box contains: ${stringBox.getContent}\") // Create an uninitialized Box of List val listBox = new Box[List[Int]]() listBox.setContent(List(1, 2, 3, 4)) println(s\"List Box contains: ${listBox.getContent}\") } } Output:\nInteger Box contains: 42 String Box contains: Scala Generics List Box contains: List(1, 2, 3, 4) ","wordCount":"1821","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:51064/ShareNotes/%3Cimage%20path/url%3E","datePublished":"2024-12-28T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-12-28T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Lisa Lin"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:51064/ShareNotes/posts/programming-language/scala/scala-for-data-scientists/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"ML \u0026 DATA \u0026 CODE \u0026 CURIOSITY","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:51064/ShareNotes/images/favicon/curiousity_head.png"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:51064/ShareNotes/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=http://localhost:51064/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://localhost:51064/ShareNotes/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:51064/ShareNotes/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=http://localhost:51064/ShareNotes/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=http://localhost:51064/ShareNotes/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">The Path of Scala 1: From Beginner to Data Pipeline Mastery - Scala Basics</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-12-28 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 28, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;9 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1821 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Lisa Lin&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/Lisa06010416/HugoEngineer/tree/master/content/posts/programming-language/scala/scala-for-data-scientists/index.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#variables>Variables</a></li><li><a href=#flow-control>Flow Control</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=#scala-vs-java-in-object-and-class>Scala v.s.
