# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.

title: "My New Hugo Site"
theme: PaperMod
```

Push to your git repo

```
git add . && git commit -m 'change theme' -a && git push
```
